# Java Swing MVC Boilerplate

A simple Java swing project based on Model View Controller design patterns. 

You can start your new project right away from this boilerplate with some minor changes.

This project shows how to implement Model View Controller with file handling and basic Object Oriented Programming principles.

It helps you to add user details, write those details to a text file and read those files to load into table.
